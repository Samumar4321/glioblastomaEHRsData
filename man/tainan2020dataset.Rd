\description{
Data form patients affected by GBM in the Tainan and Taiwan medical centers and affiliated branches between 2005 and 2016.\cr
It contains data from 84 patients, ranging from demographical information (age and sex) and
treatment characteristics (chemotherapy, radiation volume and dose) to
surgical details and outcomes (Overall and Progress Free Survival).\cr
The dataset focuses on the impact of radiation volume and dose;
it finds that patients with an elevated radiation dose (>60.0 Gy) had better median PFS and OS compared to patients who received a standard radiation dose.\cr
Some data may be missing due to the nature of clinical records.
