Description: Provides functions to load and analyze three open Electronic
    Health Records (EHRs) datasets of patients diagnosed with
    glioblastoma, previously released under the Creative Common
    Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.  Users can generate
    basic descriptive statistics, frequency tables and save descriptive
    summary tables, as well as create and export univariate or bivariate
    plots.  The package is designed to work with the included datasets and
    to facilitate quick exploratory data analysis and reporting.  More
    information about these three datasets of EHRs of patients with
    glioblastoma can be found in this article: Gabriel Cerono, Ombretta
    Melaiu, and Davide Chicco, 'Clinical feature ranking based on ensemble
    machine learning reveals top survival factors for glioblastoma
    multiforme', Journal of Healthcare Informatics Research 8, 1-18 (March
    2024).  <10.1007/s41666-023-00138-1>.
